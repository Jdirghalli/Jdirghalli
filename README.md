I am a first-year Higher Education Administration Ph.D. student at the University of Florida striving to further research in affordability and access to post-secondary education. My professional experience leading up to my Ph.D. program has been working in Financial Aid, Admissions, and Tutoring Centers for the last six years at two-year and four-year institutions.
